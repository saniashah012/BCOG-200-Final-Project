1. This program generates a random rap song using the pronouncing library in Python. It utilizes various functions to find rhyming words, generate additional lines, select words and lyrics randomly, and create memes based on the generated rap song. The program generates a random rap song using the pronouncing library. It selects a random word and finds rhyming words for it to construct the rap song. A function is provided to find rhyming words for a given word using the pronouncing library. It returns a list of rhyming words. Another function generates additional lines for the rap song. Each line is constructed by selecting a random word, finding rhyming words for it, and combining it with a rhyming word chosen in the first line. The number of lines in each rap song varies between 4 and 8 to add complexity and variability to the output. The program uses the random library to select words and lyrics from the lists, combining them into a rap song. The program utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to generate a meme based on the randomly generated rap song. It saves the meme in the same directory as the script.
