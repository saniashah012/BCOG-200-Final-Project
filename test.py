Download the meme template image.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and meme template image.

Run the script using Python: python3 python_script.py
Follow the prompts to generate a random rap song.
Creating a Meme:

After the rap song is generated, the program will prompt you to create a meme based on the rap song.
Confirm to create the meme.
Verification:

Check the directory where the script is located for the generated meme image (rap_meme.jpg).
Open the meme image to verify that it contains the generated rap song text.
Example Data:
The example data for testing includes the meme template image (meme_template.jpg) and any random rap songs generated during the test.
Expected Result:
The program should successfully generate a random rap song and create a meme based on it.
The generated meme image should contain the text of the rap song.
